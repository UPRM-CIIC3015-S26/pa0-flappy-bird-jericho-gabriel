Welcome to PA0 – Flappy Bird! Throughout this code, you are going to find a recreation of a game you have probably
heard of before. This is an introductory assignment designed to help you familiarize yourself with what you can expect 
in future PAs. In this PA, you will barely need to code—mostly just tweaking some variable values and implementing
fewer than five lines of new code. It is recommended that you read through the code and the comments explaining 
some of the game mechanics.
